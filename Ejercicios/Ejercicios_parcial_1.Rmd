2.16. A study of babies [1] hypothesized that babies would take longer to
learn to crawl in colder months because the extra clothing restricts their
movement. From 1988–1991, the babies’ first crawling age and the average
monthly temperature six months after birth (when “infants presumably enter the window of locomotor readiness”; p. 72) were recorded. The parents
reported the birth month, and age when their baby first crept or crawled a
distance of four feet in one minute. Data were collected at the University of
Denver Infant Study Center on 208 boys and 206 girls, and summarized by
the birth month (Table 2.10; data set: crawl).
